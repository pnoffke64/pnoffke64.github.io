<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is Parker Noffke and I am a fellow SOftware Engineering major. 
I graduated from Robert M LaFollette High School waay over in Madison, Wisconsin!
Some of my hobbies are running, reading, being active, camping/enjoying the outdoors, and playing video games.
Also, I am deaf but I use a cochlear implant to hear in my right ear. 
I enjoy learning new things so I like reading things like National Geographic.
I have been a big fan of Star Wars for a long time, so I have seen most of the shows (at least I think so).
I am excited to spend my next 5 years at RIT with such a great college!</p>
